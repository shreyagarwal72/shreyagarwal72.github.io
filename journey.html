    <h1>🎬 <em>My Life, My Game — A Short Story</em> 🔥</h1>
    <p>
      In the city of Agra, known for its timeless beauty, a new story was quietly unfolding — mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once just an average boy, caught between dreams and doubts, I wandered through life unsure, desperate to stand out but unsure how.
    </p>
    <p>
      School was never too hard, never too easy. I wasn't a topper, but I wasn’t lost either. Maths was my escape — numbers made sense, even when life didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a spark — YouTube and Gaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      While others scrolled, I created. I wasn't just watching stories... I was building mine. From shaky beginnings to bold content, I started shaping a new path — not for likes, but for legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I’m in Class 11, balancing books with thumbnails, equations with edits — not perfect, but persistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I know, the boy I was five years ago would be proud of the person I’m becoming now.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this? This is just the beginning.
