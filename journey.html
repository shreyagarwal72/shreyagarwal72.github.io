      <h2>🎬 My Life, My Game — A Short Story 🔥</h2>
      <p>
        In the city of Agra, known for its timeless beauty, a new story was quietly unfolding — mine.
        <br><br>
        Once just an average boy, caught between dreams and doubts, I wandered through life unsure, desperate to stand out but unsure how.
        <br><br>
        School was never too hard, never too easy. I wasn't a topper, but I wasn’t lost either. Maths was my escape — numbers made sense, even when life didn’t.
        <br><br>
        Then came a spark — YouTube and Gaming.
        <br><br>
        While others scrolled, I created. I wasn't just watching stories... I was building mine. From shaky beginnings to bold content, I started shaping a new path — not for likes, but for legacy.
        <br><br>
        Today, I’m in Class 11, balancing books with thumbnails, equations with edits — not perfect, but persistent.
        <br><br>
        Because I know, the boy I was five years ago would be proud of the person I’m becoming now.
        <br><br>
        And this? This is just the beginning.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Nextup Studio isn’t just a name.</strong><br>
        It’s a reminder:
