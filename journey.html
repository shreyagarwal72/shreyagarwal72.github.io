    <h1>🎬 My Life, My Game — A Short Story 🔥</h1>
    <p>In the city of Agra, known for its timeless beauty, a new story was quietly unfolding — mine.</p>
    <p>Once just an average boy, caught between dreams and doubts, I wandered through life unsure, desperate to stand out but unsure how.</p>
    <p>School was never too hard, never too easy. I wasn't a topper, but I wasn’t lost either. Maths was my escape — numbers made sense, even when life didn’t.</p>
    <p>Then came a spark — YouTube and Gaming.</p>
    <p>While others scrolled, I created. I wasn't just watching stories... I was building mine. From shaky beginnings to bold content, I started shaping a new path — not for likes, but for legacy.</p>
    <p>Today, I’m in Class 11, balancing books with thumbnails, equations with edits — not perfect, but persistent.</p>
    <p>Because I know, the boy I was five years ago would be proud of the person I’m becoming now.</p>
    <p>And this? This is just the beginning.</p>
    <p><strong>Nextup Studio</strong> isn’t just a name. It’s a reminder:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📍 From Agra to the algorithm</li>
      <li>📍 From average to amazing</li>
      <li>📍 From watching to winning</li>
    </ul>
